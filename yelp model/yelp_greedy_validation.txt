so much fun from does it begin to finish . if you like to dance in the dark do not have to perform a death rope stunt . you . truly a death rope trick . ! .
good wash and they hold you straight with the straight razor . they don t do a rough shave , its not coarse sheep , but who cuts dry wool ? .
a must see someone in full costume here . if you can dance , they do not have to perform some fabulous choreography to be on stage . and don t wear a wig ! .
