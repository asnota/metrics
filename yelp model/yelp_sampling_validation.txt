there are two entrances where you can cross and enter on south street from the city center to watch the santa fe train .
decent hotel rooms are good but the price and the bed was way old and uncomfortable . security only two foot massage , no one stall where a person could sit so there is nothing to write home about .

she not only touched me with her gloves , she touched me with her hand while i did . i managed to grab it and she could hold on my arm as i then saw just tossed the knife and left .
beautiful lazy river park on the lake , with the two lane parkway that is easier to navigate . i rented a boat for a water race and they had no lights . professional swimmers are just average . there is a swimmer on the day and you have to dive board in each pool .
very good relaxing massage in the crate chair . also give foot massage in the lounge chair . then do yourself a favor and sit and enjoy your massage in those wooden chairs .
loved the lobster pot [UNK] . the sandwiches are a huge hit for kids . especially their chocolate [UNK] . so creamy ! .
i went in to change on my bike then the two guys came out and helped fix for me so i could change out my front flat tire . then my other tire is that it is completely flat right now . .

this place , doesn t blow your mind when you only have a bubble tea or cream pop with a new toy in the store ? .

great environment . the music is a little loud and the seats run fast . i love the [UNK] and i would recommend .
the service here is not good but they cannot hold you over for nothing compares to even an open grill in the kitchen space . why does that they would even have opened a single stand let alone call customer service . really ? .
i had a great experience with southwest air rental center . jerry , who let me shake my hand , was patient and had enthusiasm helped me have it smooth on my ride while away from the curb to the airport .
favorite place for a hot dog fix . the best that i can eat a hot dog the house of the world ! .
get up and dance real loud if you want a female bartender . just do it for the male who is on you .
the worst . cut off the comb . not one piece of hair , not a cut . will never use again ! .

love this bar . always fun music , a pole is the snow pole , and a vault in the summer .
came by today and door tag showed up in my hand not even stayed open and closed when i left .
horrible place , they say bed shoes . i only had on a shirt i couldn t even care . never wear it again .
by far the best lashes that i have had they only apply to them on my chest . i had to wash down the inside . the lady she was kind of rude and was cautious about my makeup and she was not only friendly or helpful as well .
good food but a beverage over filled my glass when i poured it and the pour should have been empty .
this is a dive bar . a dive with no good you just have to jump your ass off jumping in a pool . terrible .

i love this place , take your dog here and don t cry when i pull her out of her , she practically [UNK] happy . amazing ! .
the worst place to go out of your way for a quad leg line up . asked for the manager to do a full shave your legs and he did them in front of them . you can at and watch the strip from so be ready to leave .

fun place for sunday night night football . look forward to the game or just watch . won t throw any shit away ! .
by far the best places to eat in vegas excellent staff awesome food amazing and you have no room to wait .
what a fun bar to watch some best looking basketball and oh well , you wouldn t have either of room to handle a large crowd with people in the exception of no one and only two women bartender near in front of us uncomfortable . i would definitely recommend this place .
the smell not good at all , the girl in the bathroom had a paper towel not a paper wipe for face , and i saw the towel wash away . will never come back again .
this show is absolutely stunning . the women that dress are very fancy and fancy , so you re in front of the girls to perform , it is awkward , but from the center of the stage is not horrible . this was definitely worth every penny ! .
i get my new clutch machine here and it never happens like a few hours . you have to sit real close to the counter , yet still not run properly . anyway , the work is done well . i would definitely recommend .
very fun family atmosphere with board games . had the dart and my friend had and it . hit the spot .
just got a cut on my head , probably the worst razor shave ever . my neck on the burnt side ! .
near downtown phoenix , lazy river and golf course and the red rock is steady . definitely worth to walk again .
food was very salty . i won t eat lunch here again . the staff inside the restaurant is dirty and the rest of the staff is they don t care to talk to customers .
over crowded . very expensive equipment and the toilets are at the store front of you only one worker stand at each other though .
today , dropped it off in the same carriage , and had to have to remind them ring the front when they pulled a draw on the car instead of pulling out a full horse right away , using my own ticket .
went in today for a light brush , and with a nice touch to clean up after the wash with a hand wipe wet down the window so it looked clean again . i will do the same here .
the very best hair barber i ever had cut myself . the head , neck , and scalp shave was amazing ! .
security is not here . the problem is all you can move , they are slow they don t even stand out straight , and only have to pose for poses for pose so i literally watch them through the whole process ! .
went up to the peak for a quick climb a large tree that hit me on the face instead of it . then leg hurt and i slipped on a rope . i will not be doing this again .

the pools are great and i am able to jump in . i m guessing no one at a pool but a normal person can stand in the lounge watching tv .
went to the cardinals game and saw that baseball pitch . fun . i didn t even throw you a single ball .
i mean , hit into the ground as if i just asked for a shovel and a big chunk of snow . ? .
worst company i have ever been brought to a court my attorney booked me off and refused to hold a new client out there for at least a month so i will stand trial and witness and then did nothing they could do . ! .
loved this place . i used a hair brush and clipped several hairs . as a kid . it didn t feel like much so i went to have some tooth trim and got an eye wash in the road ! .
super fun place . you have a huge menu board that are neat and know how to play if they do a ball , then flip your hand to the so they don t even bring you water with your drink .
this will only work on the arm . if you have to jump do it don t even have to raise your arms .
a great park to just exercise , relax , and just listen to the sport instead of the usual music ! .
water leak in my front and while i was there , they replaced the mirror with a screw . also , dirty floor in the back room . i will not return nor would never return here .

awesome food . the house specialty delicious and you can sit outside or eat at a glass table ! .
the auto glass in my driveway is so horrible they gave us a ride if you to driveway and use the [UNK] now . unbelievable ! .

nice to find an instrument here . its just steps from the street and it is worth the walk for anyone in city .
beautiful day club and a nice beach . this beach is called the castle and you can enjoy the sand and surf .
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever eaten if you can t stand the raw stuff . you just don t change your mind . i had to stick to the meat like glue and burning in my tongue . do not let anyone do this .

horrible teachers rude and rude instructor . they do not intend for the student to fail even if you like to teach in public school .
service was good atmosphere , my face used to the hot rub . hot . not sure i ll sit down with another massage .
worst place for tennis if they did not touch ball i used but rather than hit me . i dropped my serve down like i wanted to play some tennis stick to forget and pay for the hit .
incredible show is truly . if you please . stage for way too long to stand around and take your seat amongst the show singing while playing a violin song , i just could only dream of that show ! .
this place is amazing . i bought a bath bombs and covers . they do look wonderful with my puppy . the staff i [UNK] are really nice , the staff was very good with my dog and will definitely come back ! .
non football game . un allowed bowling . no player should not allowed in or even reach for a shot to throw . never a second chance to see a team don t run away with their play .
awesome place to take the kids if you forget . they can actually jump in and run around while your kids play slides , slides , slide , lake or sometimes even down to the water for a nice view .
i ve been here a couple of days . the pool is amazing . kids the opportunity to swim around was really nice .
dropped a ball and the coach touched it with hold and didn t open anything on my shirt . gross .
rented an old paddle boat and was able to float around on a paddle on the lazy river ! .
nice little park and boat at . couple boat and then a paddle in with your boat from the south shore end of the lake .
love their food here they have a wonderful beer and i have really have any complaints . we can t drink most were good . it is a pretty small place and it has to much room and the weather is very nice .
team members are very professional and engage with customers in a football game . the goal is helping every team of customers .
fun . was kid , but the girl our did the rock star . i would say skip this one again ! .
this place is very well worth the long line for goodness all of these things are an crazy lame , some tourist trap with places that are just like that in vegas this is no south park kinda thing here . a plus that its also a pretty cool damn water slide that just goes right : past by this last one slides out kind of which almost hits all kinds of where the clubs other hand broken hearted slot machines etc , etc and i can they not only wait on here just to get you to come open up more dollar bars way too close . no fun club ! . go anywhere else but do it if
this place is a joke . each dish needs to be prepared on the chefs , not by the kitchen . orders should take extra care to prepare and it will be good for repeat customers .
great workout for casual [UNK] . it is off the road near the lazy dog track or lone runner ! .
great food , i would never visit again to eat here but had my friends burger and the fries , and a hamburger are both were delicious , and they served us to our on table was . amazing . ! .
great people taking a backseat and actually allow you to drive the car and don t even want to sit there .
great old vegas mix up of horse racing . no older horses rode for the ride . large pine tree and a small cabin .
food is very good . they cook does a great job being in the kitchen , but when i told the other person who was always working my stove shut off and he is the only one who works there ! .
wonderful park . for a body riding , to boat or canoe launch on the lake with just above water between its upper limits .
watched the fountains perform with fabulous choreography . the main performer will not be on stage . would highly recommend .
shouldn t dropped a ball when the ball touched one side of the basket falling apart . just throw a stick .
epic boat . they pull out a whole boat like a raft and move in the water ! .
the food is good if you can hold them upside down and sit anywhere underneath a tree , tree or a below tree .
the worst treasure ever . dig deeper and deep dug out a plant that was growing into a small tree . unbelievable ! .
i went in and cut and styled my hair just how i wanted , style it ! .
great fun we were able to grab a ball and being able to throw to my dad . as an older kid who was on the game she couldn t catch a ball so i could toss about eight balls . made the whole experience fun ! .
matt did such a wonderful job on my stairs . i had one tool removed and was told he was able to cut the wood apart unlike other places with his tools and did very good work . they would have to recommend them ! .
horrible store you have to jump over a car and a pile of garbage . and then run away .
great food terrible service . floor has dirty looking , and it looks like my dirty rag and a t shirt . the servers wearing skinny shorts attitude while customers sit at a sticky table .
bad service brown paper in the center , could not read any paper on the prep table . i left ! .
fast service , good food . great restaurant . give a for a table while you want ! .
my favorite place to buy a bow here . but they ll let you hold a semi automatic bow and then shoot at a nearby range .
horrible venue with a large crowd of fans . team . take last minute get allowed to watch the fans .
great place to learn to beach party . well maintained facility with bikini courts . no girls allowed , volleyball , sand which etc .
lost watch was left in hand bloody . lost my arm and a knife when the others left for a while i held hold down my picture saw wood in it hit my stomach .
worst dog park i ever been too . most huge gross dog park that i will ever be to . but throw in on the grassy front and side because of putting them so there is almost all that they have is weeds on inside by , beyond it has no one walking jogging paths over , and basically just dirty gross grass patches , and even beyond the grassy ball fields which there are very small patches . really nothing like any big city parks that actually stand up here . one stop signs say said these are literally only some small local parks anywhere . but whatever its still this is a real fun park ! and until then so
awesome place has many legs of which course i love it there . beautiful old school ski balls too cute . parking outside in the park is a must try if you don t go to ride in the lake but you can also enjoy there snow from giant clouds . would have been a dog park before and safe when i picked this up , and you can t stand outside i think i could not have been done that . this is the best every time .
prices are much more a guess that no item you can t find what you should look elsewhere for . it is not in stock at every other store ! .
when asked a question about how bad the manager was , he who was sitting with his hand still under his arm , she just proceeded to shake her head when she smiled and at me and took it away from me . then , she also refused to let him talk to a manager again for nothing . thank you . ! .
get mad with an old desk and a keyboard the rest of the day . new chairs though and the room is nice i didn t have to sit on it was really over price .
trees are dead and have been cut for a month . they are now all way down , weeds are in the forest is not here and you can easily rip you off easily . save your precious wood and refuse to use again .
fun little live band playing while you dance and playing dumb song with the fun music ! .
the owner washed our service dog tonight and shut us up with a leash on the beautiful park street . highly recommended ! .
this place is the only way to look , super unique . all the tables are spaced up not enough for them to stand in one roof . they lines were long but so worth the wait in line ! .
horrible place , terrible customer service i watched one dog , scared of her so took one bite , another dog couldn t even hold onto it back at all until other dog finished my food . not even offered water . i would never eat there ever again .
took a bowling that was down and knocked out one ball when i hit the bounce bank , then again and when i hit the target . again had another ball hit for me several more balls being bowled after it .
food was good but the decor of the restaurant was extremely long . the hostess never had our drinks set and when she asked her to put our glasses across the table from us , we liked it . ! .
really great food and cold air balloons . be able to jump outside . and have fun . the [UNK] are awesome ! .
this is a nice playground where kids can jump on a tower , basketball , jumping tower , and run and run around with joy . your dog can wash their hands and clean the water ! .
amazing . my favorite float spa , wonderful massage . they lasted all day and a half hours but it was nice to boat ride , the calm water , and blue wave pool like you could ever imagine ! .
very friendly owners , nice lady . she was able to lift me , and still lost some weight for two days ! .
this woman and a great athlete . i do not participate in any race . i no longer either run for running .
this place hidden in the middle of nothing fancy but good . best [UNK] . and a little secret down the street is delicious ! .
great place to spend a couple of hours with your fur kid . i can t recommend the kids room for the strip ! .
love this hotel . nice staff , beautiful room , the two rooms are comfortable bed . i took a short ride on which to get . there are hundreds of hotels and you can t wear heels , compared to las vegas i would never stay anywhere else .
amazing choreography . a winning outfit that you can t just perform . stunning choreography on the entire stage is incredible ! .
fish not holding a hold . not able to hang my net without falling apart in the water ! .
worst service never fails to fire employees . my car is just pulled to the front of the other customers then pick it up and stand outside pick it up while waiting for your vehicle .
love this place , take your dog here and bring your pup to eat and watch football . the dogs are your hair . sit in the park and have some fun when i could go again ! .
great gym . indoor gym was clean and plenty of machine seats in the room . bathrooms could use improvement ! .
by far the worst car wash . nothing out front even if you park on the street its the best .
great workout but , when you use a harness and needed more stretch , my husband had her arm backed into the wall so it pulled up and neck at all over . i wouldn t wear the same thing again , next time i need a foot massage .
i love paige . she never try to fix a color or fix . i learned how to cut my hair with the time . she is a nice and gentle lady . thank you again ! .
the bathroom on the floor was dirty . there isn t room for these people stand to wash them ? .
went in and my short black beard that wasn t even trimmed . then she was in the chair they gave me a lil tip for it . the i will never sit with her as a different barber when ever again .
beautiful desert sky park is awesome . for kid friendly , your kids can run , run and walk through the park . and an extreme wash and water feature . thank you ! .
great place for a hill bike . was able to ride it . i had to be a rider that was great ! .
by far the worst concession stands ever had . they have nothing to even hold down the concession stand and raise the microphone while singing , all the people there have a tv , do and can sit there . and i just wish i would of been for them .
it took a while to chop and this time when it hit a log couldn t even cut the wood so cold .
hotel is great but when comparing the size of the bed , they say at least it was uncomfortable . i lay all my phone on the floor without falling all over my room , definitely the worst . never again .
mini golf paths are not very clear . always make sure you careful the path from the main paths full of the snow in other paths .
ultimate extreme scuba or dive certification is for recreational diver . if you can learn to dive in the open ocean , that includes a fun and peaceful dive shooter . so not only is you swim but also , certification is for extreme scuba and a new adventure .
really enjoyed our trip here today . we took someone in a paddle boat , the navy paddle wheel . amazing . we rented a raft with it goes from their shops back up to the rocks and up the lazy river , then back down to the bow river for an awesome trip .
fun bowling alley . one ball is hit , you throw the ball at them , it is a quick turn right then and left .
the service is terrible , they said the bathrooms were so [UNK] and disgusting . i m not even sure you could call them correctly if they run into a leak . it kept running like water . terrible , never using them again .
good spot to watch the occasional sunday afternoon football league . being a football year , there is no line to each game , but over the end of football season you have a great way to watch all of your best goal bowl games ! .
i really like this gym . they provide fitness class , a press room , jungle fitness classes and a weight room ! .
its nice to have them push yourself up and down and sit . not much weight , they swing off of losing weight .
always great job by hand with my nails they dry . they turn orange yellow . never had another guy wash my hands before ! .
still good . the first chair made me treat my daughter like a mother sitting in her chair wish she could sit at the massage chairs .
love this place its awesome . great collection of amenities . huge pool area , and music in this pool is a challenge and then if you swim on the pool , they will show you to be okay . make sure you wear your swim clothes to tie it , i love this place ! .
horrible you can t cut it with a fork and knife , didn t even [UNK] to say that even .
don t waste extra time with mine on car shopping . my seat cover was awkward and they adjusted my seat just a bit so that , they even tried to disturb me for trying to sleep . i checked the car before i left .
when fixing my shoes is dirty . the strap in my shoe that was the only one they brought me a new sole and refused to teach me to soft the sole . did not have idea how to properly tie a shoe up , but can you even par shoe sole ? .
best place you can take your dog out on the track . you don t need to pull me in so i can get my car to a race . good job guys ! .
great food and drinks both indoor and outdoor , fun . and the [UNK] is the best if you don t wear jeans or skinny shorts .
very nice with my hair cut she did not cut my hair . such a nice lady . awesome job ! .
instead of them slamming your microphone in the air while you hear them sing a different song . ? .
i really wish they would of had more room and bring your own stamp card for my group , no pitchers of beer . and watch the game almost too loud . and if you like for to bowl , you can play shuffle boards though ! .
amazing choreography . amazing dance performance not only is the choreography amazing it s a typical dance outfit , but the choreography pushes it with the energy of the stage act . i recommend to see this if you are any age .
rubber shoes and dirty . horrible shoe policy . is one is the is short nails on sole on other i will wear only my shoes .
great pool tables are ground but if you ask for a to sit outside you ll have to stand on the floor .
love the music . blow out , can t just sit down or just have a conversation and smoke out without screaming .
great customer service . buy a guitar amp was awesome . i can only imagine where i d sit on that i would highly recommend coming here if you guys don t wear strings , or you aren t think so worth it out ! .
i got a bowl and my daughter had th orange peel , the cheese chunks and the sweet potato salad . both amazing .
loud for kids specially with the bigger kid , and little one has to talk to us . usually have to walk out of room .
alex did a great job , i had some ugly pieces of paint throughout my entire home and when it line up a wall , i wanted to be able to paint all the picture . dave was hard worker , and did a great job on the decor ! .
good neighborhood . higher ground pit where you have to sit on the wings while you have to watch the ball ! .
the worst room has a silk bed they will put anything under and flip my book over it if the windows are closed or you can just hold over your entire book . i have to worry while i sit and read .
we really went to heinz field for the sunday football . the kicker player such a great guy to talk with was awesome ! .
not bad , the cliff is very steep and you can climb if you have hours . the top itself is pretty sheer .
came before nine minutes without a game . the broncos scored one touchdown on two touchdowns , both of which three were from the field , but they missed out on only two of the posts . then charged extra for the fourth extra goal . not good enough at a sports bar fire cook after three failed attempts to get the score tied but would never return in a pinch game .
got a nice brush and left my hand massage with a scrub and it is soaked and my other shoe that was gross ! .
starbucks on hold over for fifteen minutes then sit here for fifteen minutes with not one smile ! .
food is very good . rice and potato side dishes they are also a little expensive . i like to sit pretty close to the fire , but wish we had an open table in this heat . it was fun ! but
this place is filthy . no coffee , every cup with no tv and all seats smell like someone was set on fire trying to hold off a candle while we are still waiting in my friend for my waiter to talk to anyone . what is the point ? .
fun . my kid loves to play here . the park has a small playground , games , swing , and a waterfall .
a great combination of music and entertainment . if you want to perform a full production show you can watch the show .
beautiful show . and if just by walking distance or just to walk through the strip , please look at this show , and your eyes will be absolutely stunning . you can literally stand there a view of these fountains . ! .
horrible place , it was rough driving with nasty [UNK] hitting my head twice , my arms were all dirty and cuts above my shoulder . this is a first time and i have never return to anything as a snake that was everywhere . this is where i will be back ! .
great live music venue . and great to cheer back old memories . if you guys will find you meet with the older crowd and we had a wonderful performance here , thanks ladies ! if
the performers were very entertaining and a audience was singing your guitar playing a different song as sung from the center of the stage . would return .
wonderful park for hockey , softball , ball legal with sand and basketball court , tennis , volleyball , and a kid playground .
a great free show and dance numbers . my little boy is a kid but they also like to bounce on stage too ! .
average food but cannot compete with supermarket . they have a decent crowd . and a line in front of the door stall .
nice interesting structure to cross view of the grand canal of the river , on a rough rock , off park road .
greatest for calgary pizza and hockey game tied among the best modern games with one player . pair both of luck and just one shot night , you win ! .
the best thing is the fence they hold all the doors open when it is not nearly wide enough for us to stand out front of , that you have to watch the fountains ? .
great place for fishing gear , if you don t need to wear all of that stuff . no [UNK] are the price though .
love this spot to catch great fish for some of the fresh ocean weather to be . passionate surfer and the shark adventure .
really bad experience taking a boat without floats . i learned how to carry the boat on the water . an awesome experience .
second time here , and i can t give it more ten stars . the taste was good but the presentation is terrible to guess what . it is that . save room for dessert ? .
worst hotel ever , refused to apply . they had just done some plaster on the interior wall , never them again .
awesome place . bought a guitar , a half neck board and t shirt for my brother brought back from [UNK] for my birthday ! .
my fish smashed into such a tennis ball . the chips were rock hard , ground . we rolled them into just a soft roll and we left hungry .
this place is terrible . and the lady there didn t even paint . wouldn t even get to the picture ! .
fun . lots of crowd to watch the game too . talented young football player . will definitely return .
fun as a little kid but i m not expecting much to look at . huge t shirt though .
beautiful park right by the shore , and , if you choose , stand outside on a ledge , watch the water for a great sight .
went there last sunday for lunch and a bag of tropical tea . the kids also have to sit down and put the bags by their side of a picnic table do no blankets . it was pretty filthy .
best experience ever . bed to the staff even offered a nice blanket on my body even had my body lay there for a while .
worst food ever . they cut myself right out of the kitchen sink and they gave me a plastic knife . disgusting and gross .
excellent instructors . they have a passion to demonstrate all the forms and why . this makes it very fun to talk about , do techniques you are all given your technique so you can t beat them ! .
they brought home the cutting board it had looked better cut it with a knife and slice it away .
so much fun . had hockey ball and a hockey ball . fetch and a goal ball that you can throw for free .
staff was very helpful picking my bike up and i had a laugh . thank you not so pleasant ride all day .
best place to watch a game of the world league rink hockey since i wasn t even a hockey player for hell .
great hotel . good room , nice pool area to sit in . all the lobby was pretty clean smelling . the television is very modern and relatively inexpensive so i would stay here again .
this is so cool . you can stand in front of a tree next to the window and watch the whole world .
my hair was to cover sunglasses to hide my face . the sun i learned how to sit out in the sun .
great senior football baseball field , basketball fields and hockey fields and one of the camp run for a public park .

great performance . the audience is right up in front of me , i highly recommend this [UNK] show ! .
awesome exploration store . have to climb a huge wooden climbing stand , and a climbing wall in the target center .
watch all over your head and neck for the sugar shake . shake is like . you can watch for your drink .
this is a great high school , with minimal competition and there are no surprises . for people wanting to learn music and dance yourself . if optional for students but required all students to perform and no more students our part .
the boat is empty , no central body and no steering . i saw the head of a worker in our raft that was boarded . it was not even on the water simply to see how to ship anyone ! .
what s a bad music in the background , nothing no signage out front of you . but how can t stand to do it ? .
love it . big baseball fields , natural grass and sand volleyball field , beautiful dog park and kid park .
the worst car wash ever with my car glove with one hand shake and they left water on my head . didn t even put back in the car after it .
great hotel . a little away from my house so you don t have much to look once you walk into a bathroom and they have a very big picture window for the hallway in the front door ! .
this hotel and now just puts me on hold all the phone when i called the lobby to my room . how long do they have a reservation . do yourself a walk down because of their locked doors closed ! .
i love to blow my hair with bubble bath , they have the best magic wand in the world ! .
old fashioned . cheap drill on my kitchen sink drain and a piece of small piece of wood inside sink was not .
had fun . hitting a ball in the middle of the court . hit the ball out for a pass that was a foul .
amazing show . the [UNK] is not a singer , she even sang along with the song it was into ! .
typical bowling hit a ball , car wreck , hit down some other balls . and then turn away .
delicious salmon . only catch fresh fish and if you fish like that , stick to a pole and check everything ! .

no good thing cut with fork and knife . kitchen doesn t know what meat was ! .
fun . every ride is one of those that stand in line while watching the wave ! .
is there employees just shake there head , their shoulders , and they shake their eyes then stand and walk away . thanks .
employees there do not clap . no at all for the largest crowd and do not raise your hand at least be like .
always nice to watch while watching your boat run , even on a day . or as you move along with your paddle boat and roll in the water . just beautiful , but nice addition driving out of old town .
worst service rude staff cold beer not even a glass . and bad i d have to hold a longer on the tap .
i shipped a car today showed up and opened door pulled into a garage so the passenger door to be closing . window was wide open so garage does not fully open locked and when it lock didn t slide off the car . avoid this ever again .
great but a really comfortable bed , the lobby area of the room is very nice . i had to look at the swimming pool , and balcony tv with a leather sofa that i could sit on . it was pretty nice touch ! .
car wash . drove in the car wash did not have a picture of my bmw so could look at it from the inside , but i saw it through a pic in the window , what gives . to much ? .
this place is good for the younger crowd is lots of screaming kids wanting to jump in and wave one more arm to watch the game ! .
too old and my favorite couch ever . i didn t want to lay down . i still sleep when we left .
dirty place . the food is so nasty . you can t hold it on their bucket seats and the chairs have no napkin . you can t stand in the food and you will also have to walk over to look on a table in one of their bathroom stalls . disgusting and gross .
love this place for our boys on their basketball court where they fun games where you can hit any golf golf hoop or can t hit or a tennis ball if it hits the ball . they shoot pool and a box is the whole game too ! .
if you are not . easy , climb them . they had my kid and i just climbing a ladder into a tree .
great job for concrete . i have just had another pour after it at my tires on my truck will be satisfied ! .
expensive . but worth the drive though . much better value than swiss [UNK] shops , and its right up the street much better .
yard hockey game still pass on catching the puck on a hockey player will not hit the puck with his stick .
bowling boy tossed a ball and touched my teammate and we couldn t even bothered to throw . i just left .
wow they were very professional and were able to fix the problem with my hair . it is a beautiful job . i wish it is not in to the mirror , but there was honest to you will fix it .
went in to get out to fix a key for some body piece on my car , and they kicked it right up in the front of my car because i waited . they also provided water , thank you guys ! .
had the calf here it was amazing also the cowboy roll is a must have . my [UNK] this spot .
too bad : did lap dance . girls dancing bare chests in front of customers too long hair lady doing was not dancing .
great experience but the lady that did the paint her hair using the process to do my picture was terrible . she asked to paint on my sister too , but i guess that is okay i can post a picture piece of it . do it up she ruined my hair ! .
great place for a quick hike on the city . church hill is also covered in water . huge playground equipment for your kid , climbing slides , a huge playground , a volleyball slides and a huge slide set up your kids don t just fall off and miss it .
the police does not like direct . where you can you have any policeman departments to enforce the peace . traffic police .

this was a great day . no horse shoes , and fun to ride around . i enjoyed the time and was there ! .
if people listen to music . do not sit down and just listen or talk to other .
two tables , no high chairs only four side tables and a single chair , even sit outside and eat here at night . i just don t want that from the inside . the [UNK] are my favorite but it is very good .
transportation is very convenient i don t use the shuttle or take your car around here , i have to use the gas station stop for my ride . parking is a little hard to find and close to the street where it however , i will definitely go again .
very nice little place . beautiful rock , climb and huge rock climbing for free . there is a jump rope tree above the falls , but not a mini waterfall . sometimes you just not enough water as a full fall .
great gym . they perform high precision on the proper routine . they are professional and the team is friendly .
ask for a shirt , button downs , or tie . all . i will never wear it again .
a great place to watch the board play . we watched the snow birds fall off . we run , and the ride length was fun ! .
superb . by pack horse and four other horses . excellent ride and excellent views of the snake river . highly recommend .
this just ridiculous nasty gross disgusting . and if its the best massage chairs , they really can t have you over to any where other than lap you to actually seat yourself down . oh and only when these are done you still feel like sitting on all the same positions , then again why not sit that down one more position . then why ever do that they must not even have enough arm massage those chairs you are comfortable with and no more [UNK] is for me , please relax . i don t even say what i probably ate them all because .
what horrible service they left it in to my daughters car keys , on and then they say didn t even even put the rubber hose back on me . if you really can t seriously imagine what i so could do clean it up with them just like a stupid simple car wash and now . i just like how mad bout that dumb ass toyota ? please . forget it .
service was great . bathroom is floor dirty but they managed to kick one leg on the table and sit on a different table .
staff here is very rude . one arm is raised to the air and my other open hand holds her mouth while telling her to hold down his shoulder and says to not raise my eyebrows . no , no thanks .
great place to fly in . i had a blast at spark and this is my hometown . the [UNK] are a blast ! .
this place is disgusting . had to scratch my head twice and when asked if i wanted a t shirt , they found it and they just ripped it very unfortunate . i would not wear it again . terrible experience ! .
get in and fold from one tip to each hand , they even hold anything on the stand then have them folded .
great show . my instructor wendy did not perform any dance routines or even assisted during her routine in the rink . they couldn t even tell i was a non ice skater . the rink was a little fun though .
went today there was no chair . all the chairs are on the floor and i did not have room to sit . ? .
we went there on a saturday evening to see the firing of a bull riding event , and we were pleasantly surprised . no dj drew a mixed crowd , but whatever it was at least one of the weekends with little ride to watch .
these guys are amazing . don t prepare to run in a race , and do they want me to run next day .
great place to watch a game , the wings are really good . they make their popcorn and the best part of it is the popcorn treats you like a refrigerator . you can also take my food home . highly recommend .
the park , a football baseball that is located right next to chase field . it was perfect for college football team spring training . ! .
so much fun . book here if you want to look best . all . the deluxe [UNK] are best ! .
do not go here and forward . still are on hold of us with open account nope , someone is the person on a phone . instead of talking to all of you who can t walk away from this firm ! .
worst customer service ever . the drive thru is so slow , take your hat down and don t wear it anymore . ! .
the worst hamburger had to cut a knife in one piece using a dirty tool , not at all .
good people . nice pool party . was looking for a nice suit and they let me out during my swim and it though ! .
this place is great food specials are all delicious . the combo plate is a show you grab a chance sit in the patio ! .
good food bad when they cook on a charcoal grill . the kitchen should cook everything in a pan not a stone oven .
not only if you can t smell during a cigar , you couldn t blow out a cocktail at our table that had too much garlic . i threw the candle light up and it was a white candle . like [UNK] i probably ever again ! .
good machines , good ball court . bonus points for out scored . good game time . typical college football gym ever ! .
my favorite bowling alley . they swing a ball hard to hit the golfer with them and then you can hit a hole , just miss . i only one swing , so much fun .
they have already left my car to be cleaned . they can t cover up all the snow because it was so covered with the snow they started to fall off it and into the street , what a rip off . ! .
great place for a no mat machine . but you will have to perform on just the basic open air fitness routine , no thanks ! .
great to eat at this place , food was good service was excellent . the lady working in front of us was super friendly . i would definitely recommend this restaurant .
amazing . watched more during a costume change than if you re not on stage wearing your own costumes and not stand on the water ! .
great service , nice setting . the fountains at [UNK] , especially when you enjoy watching the water move , with their choreographed music , to monitor a tropical or giant wave and bounce off the main center part of the strip .
this is a nice park . from snow skate , lift hill was very smooth and narrow . kids also peaceful . have a blanket for them ride too . if you again . we also did the gap trail up to [UNK] and just do it out ! and
amazing . i fall in trusting your body bounce off and fall upside down the bridge . then stop and enjoy the water while you fall .
i m putting on hold and still wearing a pair of running shoe . still .
this is , by far , my favorite spot for a bike ride . we took myself in the morning to this beautiful ride , complete with incredible views on or out of a river , and with the best view of the desert .
great concept they are so much cool to decorate our decorations too . all of their decorations are interesting and they were fun to talk about christmas and everyone is very friendly about their tree and even all the real trees during christmas .
they had great service , took my guitar there it would sound perfect , i could sit there and just lounge and watch the wood grow out . i highly recommend them .
excellent food and great open kitchen . but if you can sit at a booth eat at a sticky table . awesome restaurant ! .
first time working with enterprise . after a smooth ride , i was able to clean up the outside of my vehicle , while it was comfortable that i would not have to wear comfort shoes on the move . i would definitely use them again .
we love this place to eat in vegas . every dish on the plate is amazing . i highly recommend the spaghetti and chicken . ! .
great customer service . the staff is nice and the sit in business for a little awhile . however today i had to change a suit for me and they treated me that not only were my shirts they have no tie at all . i will absolutely use them if ever moving again .
had a great experience with all ocean clear . i have shirts and custom suit all of i would recommend and would wear to anyone is looking .
the cellar is very worn and old and there is very dusty . the climb is difficult but if you re up stairs , it is a steep flight and just steep enough to find the narrow spiral stair hanging to the left .
this place has gone down hill . they don t know how to pull out the numbers don t have enough [UNK] . ! .
unbelievable food . they could feed me all you can imagine . [UNK] tuna salad . i might as well sit outside on it ! .
one of the best hot dog . i had the angry dog ever and the [UNK] . all the dogs are awesome . hold the fries .
choreography is awesome , all the men can sing along to them . it is no choreography and this must not be done on stage , there is no line in the choreography . fabulous and there are many people stand around the aisle with their singing , fabulous performance ! .
recently they just removed the complete electric hedge wall with a whole fence and ladder and now removing trees to trim . totally impressed me .

do not wash your hands before hand and raise your legs and can hardly hold against the current or you can swim in the water .
it s not bad but if you stand under tree to talk to you won t reach under a tree with the birds flying .
no place to play adult board games and not have to carry a bottle of water . that alone ? .
very bad branch . why not even stand behind all the branches of a single tree ? .

i was hit by a disco ball before and then the oz machine was hit so hard that it also did not bounce back . then i was hit with my own head i couldn t even separate it .
worst place to buy a bottle . the bartender pays us to sip our wine and take your money .
joe was very helpful on my bike . i enjoyed the ride a little up the slope , amazing view ! .
my car is a horrible fall over , the car keeps hitting the ground . it keeps falling as if not hit all the grass below .
they scored early when we dropped the ball they just took over . so we scored my sons out goal touchdown on a three yard free kick home for the score two touchdowns vs . top of the line .
how cute place this is . they actually have the hand washing machines and the kids will grab your luggage up front door , and then take hold until you tight . why can t i really like it . not just a toy place though . very cute little store we like to be
watch a joke . that magic microphone announcing all the performers on stage they do not have to talk to a table .

great service , my dog was nice , but tight leash attached . still good to walk around with your dog .
great win situation . a wheelchair basketball game and that would have put all the big game going on and they just had balls to literally run it out of where the stadium with it goes in .
don t they ever thought you can catch a ton of salt water fish in the black perch in the frozen river too .
the worst place i ever been . no rope to every three ropes . how why can t you not stand in there and schedule yet they still walk out ? .
don t get me a blue ball here . waitress couldn t catch it and hit me with the pitcher . better luck .
good show . just no cigarette in the front of hotel resort with the beautiful fountain show and a nice view to the pool . not much like from a casino stand out and its still worth it .

great staff but bathroom not clean the restroom also saw dirt on the floor but they did clean it so worker should be fired ! .
great group playing smooth air hockey without making everyone is screaming out loud . catch a ball and throw it for free .

bad service , food was ok had to ask to stand behind the counter . then finally have them pay for me to bring us a [UNK] on the food . they did t even take water . i m not sure i will return .
really great place . if they have a book that is put on a super uncomfortable seat then you have a baby on your lap and elbow against the bedside lamp . while it is with your way to have read a book , you will not be interested in here .
went in there looking to have an urgent eye that wasn t closed , nope i told them i wanted it fixed . the lady was very nice and helpful . she replaced it and put in work .
great fun to blow the horn on my little one . lawn hit dirt off my couldn t even leave mud on the lawn .

very great place to let your kid run to a play with , kids playground . it can even has a kids swing splash pad , etc .
terrible wash ever not only have to come and get a car wash here , but they didn t even spray on my car . worst in the area they don t even serve water . never again ! .

good bar that is hard to loud , and people that sing really well together . they sang a song they played called happy birthday baby . wow ! .
worst starbucks ever . they hold your cigarette while you stand on the sidewalk or street is no more moving without an umbrella . avoid ! .
the best cold brick , they are hard to build and he prefer hard stick mortar , but the brick is a solid wall , worth it ! .
had a broken sewing machine and they didn t even put it on i ended up sticking the [UNK] just to me my machine couldn t thread me to this .
this place is a dive bar for cheap beer . the bartender custom makes the glass right if you have to pour into your cup .
i brought in one picture on their board and they had my body ready to fall . i m t a surfer and i would just be a medium wave if you have them .
the employees standing at front of you like they leave with a hand to hold on . or hold someone , cause there is nowhere to stand in their line ! .
took long for a dry cut and a blow out of my face with just a wet towel after it but still drying couldn t wash my hands ! .
beautiful downtown phoenix . interesting bicycle heaven . an easy it is to ride your bike between downtown from the main street to the don valley for bike and walk enough . highly recommend .
such a wonderful experience we took a bath here . i also did the deluxe [UNK] scrub and calmed my husband and shy dog . i m not sure , but give them credit ! .
stopped in to grab a baseball game . i used a bat into the ground and hit a pinch ball with no player missing . very disappointing .
these guys always do a great job with the hammer on some of their concrete . my garage had a large blocks poured over my roof and shortly after the pour it off it had hardened without any cracking while leaving big chunks of rock . smooth , smooth just as well as normal rock . i am very happy , happy worker and i would highly recommend them ! .
lots of people climbing cords to jump up and hang overhead . they can perform the basic dance with a rope , or any type of routine . it or not .
super fun . bowling ball and play . a dart court and a bowling ball . if you run out of a ball , then throw the ball .
way cool . hottest crowd and they see people on the floor dance or jumping in front of club people away from the stage to be seen ! .
t shop is located within the building it not appear to be clean . security don suspend freedom of movement being when you in the window clear the security .
this is not fun but they left a dirty dish floating on the floor next to the sink . did not even touch it . i literally had to stand on the little piece of it in the floor before to wash my hands . had never washed them never washed .
the coach accidentally dropped the ball just to left field because of a foul play . he hit right over with my stick and it was bad .
great food nice bar . excellent selection of beer , and how many you can drink . good place to sit down and people watching .
played football here , and scored a kicking goal in the week against pitt , who scored on an interchange pass allowing another player that substituted in for him , who scored a try . best match he score that match win . they had two tries ever run and a full , exciting team of everyone must see you soon ! .
first timer . found a knife . the knife was a thin piece of plastic i had to throw the handle down on some wood on the floor .
love this place . can easily come every week . everything is delicious and dog treats as well . the owner is very friendly , can t wait to come back ! .
had fun playing at heinz field tonight . saw that on sunday night football was kicked in and field goal and scored touchdown . would never kick a pass again .
don t go in because the ladies at the front always do not smile . no . they have a wonderful hair cut i like going to the mirror that did the cut and didn t stand up there and even acknowledge my hair instead .
too old enough to need a face lift . only having six children and thirty four . and an old couldn t normally listen to movies in the cameras , since they didn t even play any music . but they even tried and asked me by my own weight as i asked for a bench because i did not fit .
you don t have credit card . they only have anything on the deck you won t them . they even hand you a free card or they do shuffle board ? .
this station is not have direct choice . lines are basically in the middle of the airport where you can t stand so you cannot handle the traffic from outside .
wasn t that good . the other hand . bathroom looks like if they cannot hold lamps over for toilet covers , no paper in the floor or someone tore a piece of plastic together .
great place for kids play on a bench or park . they have the ice cream ever , but i can t mind eat mine one yet while i sit on my treat .
was very easy to climb , not to far from mountain . also use rope to clear most of the side track ! .
fun hitting the ball . hit the lane . you can hit the pin out , the ball and if u roll out if playing bowling .
after manager closed my family contact lenses , the doctor prescribed me for eye glasses with an edge lens . he was very professional , very patient and put the rest into his work , so i will see him again .
dirty bathroom has a wooden ladder with broken handle . wet paint or chalk on the stand where the up ladder hanging from the wall to ceiling .
she did a great job with my curl and highlights . my mom had his hair cut into an iron edge that she needed . definitely will use their services again .
went here when our apple changed and they didn t drill holes on my apples they do not peel my apples . it is [UNK] . horrible ! .
great place to go to relax and calm your body after running or jogging with my long so happy dog absolutely loves it . there is a little to no traffic and you can easily walk to spa or run around , self wash the hot stone , and then pump water . it for your dog , too ! .
just had the worst experience during this [UNK] involving myself , my partner and the [UNK] . i was pulling the hammer out of my vehicle to break wood with a boot ! .
the fields are so fun . one field is perfect and spacious . three other fields with grass only and not just one player allowed in for use equipment as well since they have the hockey team but if you are getting competitive you will find it is a great park to walk through during the year .
damn , you can t beat the cowboy roll . crab legs and a full horse feather . you won t have to ride like this again during a rodeo ! .
this place made me laugh . it honestly felt like reading all of my paper and i found a very thin piece of plastic rip away . ! .
no coffee shop with morning newspaper , do not have anything you can read if you feel like yourself asked to sit outside on the patio on a table that looks gross .
did an awesome trick at finding the field for my five yard goal . scored on an amazing run . and made sure how long your score had been expired .
just asked for a replacement picture . they advised me with the other shirt and the most i could do is take it without any issue . never wear it again .
never get your car in . then drive away and park all your cars on their other side of the road . driving across the street , turn into the east all that way .
great concession . basket ball game there is no lines , only [UNK] and there is enough room and you only have to stand on the dance floor .
found my hair on a shirt but was wearing because they were so short and the shorts i couldn t stand . i can t even wear them a sweatshirt now .
love this place , they are right out front of it reminds me to town , i found it at the top of the machine . the first time i went there , it was so nice with ping [UNK] , you get in a pretty cool area to relax and sit and hang out . nice ! .
incredible choreography for this show . most of a crowd , the colorful , then the naked riders in the mechanical thunder and the last horse and the song . it is free ride experience alone as i take my last ride over the air . very fun ride and this is a complete highlight to watch and do at any corporate or sporting event .
great people . very nice gym . small weights and the lady is really nice they actually lift . also have and no weight loss program . ! .
whether taking pictures for my athlete . my kid even took up from hurdle running , hurdles and cross country and run after the field off on the track just jump .
i love this place , great studio the studio is so clean very welcoming , the equipment is well kept and neat . the teachers really demonstrate just how to do some basic typical yoga when it , to balance your core [UNK] , and that you just need to be in and walk right there from the window to get a free hand wash your hands ! .
amazing food , could literally eat here , after every bite went home . huge piece of it was all so delicious i just could not just sit down on and it was as i had left home . awesome [UNK] too ! .
this is your best drink in the strip you ll want to sit at a bar table . they also have a beer and wine experience .
very nice little park . the surrounding area is a mini maze with just dirt fence , walking trails and horse trail . there is a bike ride and a carousel ! .
just awful . they can t even fold this down if your reach out of paper and when they put the piece on it for you know before they take it apart .
who could she do her magic . i literally dream about the one balloon here . if i mention to be able to blow my eyelashes off dry and then pull up an extra seat at the large couch in the palazzo , maybe even cool enough to sit with the sun on a picnic . heaven ! .
the customer service was terrible . the chair that had broken nail , one hand , and an arm , it looked like the whole thing . i had to sit down and find the other seat ourselves while we waited for a beer or cat toy at all for no extra charge . i will never return again .
the worst . tossed a cardboard and even could not fold some paper apart with a small piece of it between my chest and my shirt at the front door .
not bad , the crowd is screaming out in front of me i have to perform some strange song . cheap trick did not cheap though .
great little park for dog lovers . so many different things to look at . don t miss the endless snow boots . a dog can run or stand your own ! .
my hat is a cowboy hat for the hell i blew off of my horse when riding , and i ride like one leg . now wear one . ! .
great service so i had brush and two different brushes and fixed my tooth . very quick and [UNK] . very friendly , definitely will use them again ! .
went to get a hair brush trimmed and had me with the same brush to cut my hair with . i will definitely use them again ! .
the only disappointing part is the male crowd and not the people assigned to their dance numbers . they do not perform their full performance while you watch them during the performance .
did a good job washing my dog . i didn t use the garden hose , it just cut loose and then spray my dog with some water ! .
tried to get ready for a [UNK] but left on the floor . it did not a fold a seat up where you sit nothing .
love , love your apple . this place is the best damn apple salon in town . i think the machine is super old and capable of any apple can be crisp , then able to peel it all in all the best experience my color was amazing . i will only use them every time ever again ! .
hot , hot . continue their steady and still , dance due to the song and then hold in a similar position and chest pose for during the song .
great staff and teachers . cheer up your kids on the fast lane . children can t play on the pool this time so fun also try the swim slide ! .
awesome place for kids , slides and board games . the little ones can jump around in the water , and your kid gets to just play in the picnic pool too ! .
super fun . you put together to solve a matching puzzle then you are suppose to sit in the center of the table , no luck ! .
perfect bowling swing . dropped a ball , hit bounce yet again hit the court , hit the ball with an empty hand . makes perfect play .
structure that is at the top of a cliff far from a tower and building location . you can t jump off it but the city and the tower are very narrow . you could easily watch from this site in the desert when there was no water , or free fall , and super water .
warning : do not own the car wash or use dirty gas , if you ever need to actually pump water . i would recommend any gas station as a dime ! .
one of the worst places to eat , i wouldn t even feed anyone that looks so bad . the food is served with a spoon and not very good .
amazing . do not take a camel for your bike across the desert , just relax . but ride it , if you want to walk in the desert .
great place that i can hold off while watching the rain . don t even put up an umbrella in the park so i just kinda walk by and walk away .
had my best experience a couple of weeks ago , when i only do lap dance numbers and not just danced to one of the dancers was not jumping on floor people , the dj trey had a blast and their music lit up that night . i highly recommend it for the dancing .
great park with a bench and pad . if you have a body massage , either sit outside or sit in the waterfall while waiting . beautiful water and its really nice .
so gross at all . there is a broom and carpet ball that was sitting on my floor below the counter had a hair on its shelves to hold down the snacks . i swear i saw one worker sweep out the room . so disgusting .
not sure how it would break or if they could only hold it for longer than one piece instead a piece of wood . really . ? .
best salmon anywhere . catch so many different kinds of fish . don t fly off with a net and drift down the lazy river ! .
customer service is horrible back bench is dirty . lady talking on her phone show has no chairs , we can sit for while and hear each other and talk to each other .
good venue . [UNK] . it is not a race . and i would be for a ride though that is close to the track . fun .
amazing food great service . dog run down the golf field area and they allow the dogs to hold on to a bow and stand on your legged ! .
worst place ever in arizona county court if it filed a complaint against real property someone or they will want them on hold through that potential lawsuit . it should be filed against you if they claim there was just an issue of time that money could have lost . [UNK] this is embarrassing to hear that is legal matters being filed by this madison law firm law suits . the owners are cold , dedicated and they do their best to stand their trial for each other or other . whatever you win , but it matter nothing to bring a suit .
loved my experience . rebecca is very passionate about my hair and she was so good at what she had me do a lot of my leg without having to bend up my leg when trying to remove them , though it wasn t very painful . it was painful at all without wax . i will be returning ! .
can you get a foot out of the olive garden . no grape stalks , vine leaves and smash oil . what will you stand by doing that ? .
such a fun alley for bowling . you have a golf ball , first hit another lane and then they hit it and throw it . ! .
love to play . pool fun slides basketball slide bowling slides outdoor playground . hopefully the slide has waterfall and not when the kids playing on water lots of fun .
on a hot night load my sport jacket and be able to remove the snow boots so you can walk away with them soaked . i would wear them again .
don t take your dog out running on the grass , walk , or run over after the wash and wear crab paws .
very scenic . just relax for a couple minutes on a flat ride on a lovely dirt road . cool views and good [UNK] off the main road .
not bad beach balls . do you just have to dig down and open your at the same hole and sink a little hole in the sand ! .
clearly , you must ask her to apply chalk and or polish only to further demonstrate that this is not a [UNK] . but how can a mascara ? .
needed a blow dry out with excitement but she did the [UNK] she did what i asked and my hair was even better . this lady is amazing ! .
dropped it off for air conditioning today and found my dog . it was like being in a field with a dozen small dogs would jump next to the dog .
tried to lower leg on both legs , they kicked me , i did not want to lie . brought both legs then kicked my legs because after the massage and one foot was on the table . still complained to another person .
this location is one of the top two going west on cross not even count . if you have cash out or hand your order and hold open on cash . so its right across the street , it is a fun stop .
they served me water in a dirty bottle because i didn t fill my glass . then the liquid was poured into the fountain machine . very disappointing ! .
boarded our dog here and she loves to fly , not kite . since no kite flies i really like a bird to watch at the air ! .
i came here to celebrate fact that we played in the hawks game and the general manager rudy tell his team and his fans and our steelers win all over . ! .
someone hit me in my helmet on my head with a handle . i realized it was not even on his motorcycle was not turning properly but they adjusted the brakes while adjusting the ride brake did this properly . and then adjusted some more so the bike off the road . will be using your safety precautions . .
great place for scuba gear , i was able to swim it in the open water with the water pack . i would definitely recommend anyone wear it again for me .
a must see any outfit again . as i have watched her perform is fabulous choreography on stage . wearing jeans , and wear skirts ! .
the worst ever . one foot into it this morning not only did the hand , arm , leg massage and beyond painful from head massage to toe from cracking glass ! .
good place to take your dog , only one ears . they barely hold it and nothing like giving them a leash then pulling out of their mouth when they value customers .
car parking is horrible . i reserved a car here and to pick up your rental after our last night . they never have seats in the car to wait . there is a small push against the doors as you continue to proceed across the street . just ask if you want to hit the ticket window .
love this place it has a bird collection so fun to just eat at night . never had food and chicken second hand is delicious ! .
we went the first game and they did not bowl . only player can score against each game on your team , so would have wanted to watch , you lose .
beautiful dog park with a fire pit and plenty of carts . kids run and running track and tennis shoes to watch out ! .
love the trees . apple tree looks like a bag of old when he never pick up . nice tree for christmas .
best way to describe the blow dry . dried out [UNK] i couldn t even leave . i was just under a huge pile of hair .
do not a single minute . they clap your fingers on the dirty floor , first raise your hand and then move out do not sit down . ! .
they will give you a bottle of water ordering you have a fried egg cooked with white meat . pancakes suck and they don t even [UNK] for my eggs ! .
these guys are on base . i had a baseball and they weren t able to hit a home run and run at all .
love taking the arm bench is for some work during your lunch break . my sewing machine loves to sit and relax and have lilly take some photos . ! .
was just saw when we started my boat . they were pulling down trying to hold to the handle and only pull the weight on a huge rope over the wheel .
they are not nice but didn t drill anything . they drilled a hole and it went through a piece of fucking wood even with my neighbors .
so much fun to ride around . the rides that are as [UNK] for those to be longer and long wave to get to them when they re [UNK] ! .
why do think they can give a barber named no words and no instruction . i did not even a knife . i left like i will [UNK] never ever again .
ask for an older bride for a wedding photo . as the groom you can t even have a picture and font and she ll take pictures ! .
stopped in to grab a blow out and the dry they did a bubble do it for me could not even chew , it was like a gum ! .
do not wash this . my hand stick over my head . left to rest on the grass when i sit in the sun .
asked for a t shirt and manager suggested we sit and eat at the only table wide open for me to wear it again .
i am now sitting in a chair with my bare calves hurt and right leg , i can not sit anywhere . i had a burning wax and have already left .
stopped in today for a cheese board , only . they were cast iron . so . i m not cast iron . why don t even a light shirt and be necessary ? .
not good at all . my fish sandwich isn t even has a small hole in the wall with any glass and the ice chicken had to cut my knife to pull it apart . never again ! .
i m eating a bowl of this gross mess of cereal . disgusting . i can t eat hot coffee off this table . ! .
ruby , the lady who demonstrated consent to care about a friend who has been with dogs , i thought she was a complete joke and that is it so i could not help my mistake . she didn t laugh just screamed at us and decided to leave . we couldn t even tell her that . never had a bad experience .
the most amazing funeral services . we attended a ceremony and we can witness the divine fire from my forehead to foot to my feet . i pray to our priest and then the father paul , your prayers of heavenly grace to wash your hands before washing your feet . thank you ! .
if you can t just perform an unusual feat in your ride , but the horses and [UNK] complete the trick ! .
the car wash with a nice brush job and the restroom was clean , even though i waited for the toilet they run of water . would definitely use again .
fun bar . this is the only place off the block from my house and myself on that block , but they did need coin toss [UNK] . we scored a number one round they took a shot and amazing bartender made our drink the right away . so all other team want to win each round ! .
maybe i m just about half a road block from me and now they have pizza slices for the middle . they have tiny [UNK] and the slice at the bottom , like they are cold slices they can t cut through in half . it almost tastes like a frozen dinner . they had an ice cream machine but you won t regret your kids here .
dogs say chase and chase wild , when they wait . the dog can run around or run around . no running together . the track is dirt and grass .
managed to wash while pressing the microphone while being wearing a t shirt and obviously manager gave me a [UNK] . worst night ever never wear it again .
great little kid meal . my kids had a plastic knife and stuck on pumpkin pepper and my kid insisted i just throw it away .
love this store . amazing bike and even had my kid on a mechanical bull wants me to ride in the bike down the street with me now ! .
interesting little historic building is the best for picture . definitely do not take pictures , not a tourist style or interesting history .
went there today sat on the floor window open i flipped the paper and opened and there was a long piece of hair , not edible . no sit down . just left .
my car for a few [UNK] when the wheels hit into the ground with a fist hitting my head . wash your hands inside and some lift . thanks .
cheap and easy . i grabbed an arrow by the grass that was only an older ones and just had to take my bow for a rest . i learned i can t actually shoot , and anyone who is better at shooting target , so much fun shooting in a little range .
very bad experience . my [UNK] was broken and they gave me a piece of plastic and a tool to sink and piece of wood . do not recommend .
no safety first . the ball they hit too hard to knock down . bowled into a soft pin on the ball and then throw out an incorrect ball .
absolutely disgusting my old brown and sweat lay there on my legs in his right leg massage . he kicked our table and don t even have wax as we left .

nice park . my dog does not like barking . he pull out his finger nails and they are [UNK] him with their paws in the snow but god ! .
great fun for a small field , it is one of the best fields in town that you can fly in . taxi and off the inclined planes so you may not have much to kite control just be for trains or three planes so they only run around a ball . great park ! .
nice theater with two couch , and if you wanna sit in a high chair and want more television in the side so you can easily watch the movie again .
so much fun . board games . hockey boards , dart box and even throw a ball into the wall . a consistent winner .
they messed up my paper . asked for a pencil . couldn t even a piece of my pen to write ? .
with an unbelievable touch . dropped the ball away , kicked in a field goal , and that goal was a powerful kick . scored by an extra player . a conversion ! .
john did a great job . my beard was styled with a straight razor , straight fade and beard trim . i will definitely use him again .
saw a ball before hitting the bat , but no ball made it on hold . i saw if i could throw it away .

worst service ever , bench with my friend left his hand and his hat in the floor while i continued to sit for long . will not wear gloves till then .
watched him swing his arm caught a baseball ball and returned the ball around with my hand didn t even catch the baseball and roll through until i left .
dude . all you can do is dance and how could you listen guitar to the strange mix of music played out while i was in the room . would not recommend .
very nice little park with bench benches and picnic tables outside facing the building . they have heat lamps in front of that if you just want to sit , relax people watch .
always delicious , you probably can t cut with a plastic fork , the real fork , and scratch a piece with your knife . i bought little slice of pumpkin for thanksgiving so what a treat . thank you . one of pops top notch the best .
bad location to park your car fare or pick up at victoria cross . even if you stop off at the light rail street by the subway station .
nice nicely maintained bench . you can bring your dog in and simply run around the park . its also nice to just sit outside and enjoy .
good location for a field trip . we had a good long run and there is no zipper on the uniform anymore , and they apparently do not wear it all now .
classic old style . chess pieces . open game against all four pieces . they move to a starting position with the same piece , not many pieces .
not fun . i bought a puck and another ball in the grass . ran by surprise kicked my dog into the ground with my leg , then looked like a roach ran over on me i couldn t stand there and i still left .
a great place that you can take your dog walking , park or run . you can follow your dogs down one of the parks walking beside a track . even riding your horse rides and it is awesome , so fun playground to me and your dogs for ride that alone . would definitely recommend in a friend ! .
scary park but while my kid with this stuck up snow wonderland doesn t even the [UNK] . stuck up when you throw them outside .
employees are very nice and he patiently demonstrate all that i can learn how to fold and you will be sure . my shirt isn t folded in the any way it was even .
great but it has a two bed frame and a chair in the middle . we had a cat falling asleep with not doing properly up . we did indeed lay down and sit on the couch , still a good spot to point out another pet in the balcony but was it was not a kitty ? .
insane . most of all time . stand on this fence and from sitting on a steady position , you re right there . your horse is the rear , and if you hit it will run over and jump off the road or ride down flat on your other horse rider and run past fast to avoid ! .
went in for a lock and they fixed and did some pick up parts but a nice tool was taken care of . will use again .
why would anyone touch my body . legs . legs look and rock . can t even stand there and not still float in the water . ? .
great service great food to service . enjoy dining here i highly recommend to family and friends and i can sit there at the end of a table . never disappointed ! .
it was ok . should only accept any but two stars award it for not being comedian on the stage . are the employees walk around with dignity ? .
two comfortable chairs . the lounge chair and the neighbors have one foot on the other table . the customers sit you have left to be done wash your hands ? .
if you can t attach these to your trees , i can climb on them . huge rope and hold to the tree roots .
it pretty much had to cross them if you don t have to stand distance from each other on the same street . there was a long wait for the train .
a fun long afternoon feeding a duck . i wish they had the roller flap for birds here flying above the water so you can catch a bird or wing board .
love . this local beach club ever . no one fun crowd just great for pool table and sand volleyball , etc . no complaints do not watch the games . ! .
good hot dog to wash ever . very friendly the owner is very nice will take you off and have your own hot dog , especially when we walk in with a thank you .
super fun bowling and hit the ball . its bowling is a long distance so you don t even have to stand there bowling , toss the ball and throw for free .
these guys were nice when i even brought a helmet for the ride . however , they adjusted my motorcycle tires without adjusting my seat on the rear so it couldn t sit off the rack properly . on my helmets . i will wear them as a new rider .
had a great time watching some baseball game and we decided to catch some ball , and use [UNK] on a foul ball . instead of throw me a second ball .
always have had fun to buy one piece of decorative pieces , pottery , glass pieces and a steering wheel seat . these pieces are excellent work of art ! .
a good example of how to demonstrate that this is not a lace ratio . does not the hem of shoe style . why not the hem or tie ? .
best workout with your entire body . if you workout you can skip this . and carry it out in stone slab . does body even waist the water ? .
went back to the chair just so uncomfortable . no shine on my shoes left with only one shoe on and i left oh where you sit ? .
a must see mac in full costume . it . not only does he dance , but he do incredible stunts and perform constantly moving the stage . highly recommended ! .
always so much fun at the park from road climb to the hurdle ride are amazing . we walk down the course , then run or jump over and a race no longer than the smaller perimeter running track . even after all up and concrete hurdles for you can watch as they hit their ball every year .
so convenient . but with the front bench seats and the one from the main bus lines takes too long enough to sit by yourself , skip this bus or wait to ever again .
bad that nothing they carry one and only hot dog policy . don t like dogs that run by to fill fast and stick around or you pig burn .
awesome . i scored a single ball just for extra score and the whole chase of free throw in center field . good luck the pirates team ! .
the sweet potato fries were very salty and my bowl extremely greasy like i should be like eating off a hot dog . the roll was all over after me and it smelled disgusting i could not eat again this again . the customer service is really good , but the food took a long time .
shitty shop smells like they used cigarette . even though my wife didn t look up i saw a small white puff . maybe i ll take our business elsewhere .
first experience was good on the floor , it was like a sole on shoe . they were able to sit up and sit down and helped me tie damn fast ! .
horrible place . has an old gardens hedge within few rooms , falling tree growing old man with the ax and a bamboo ladder w a kitchen and an old weeds over the top instead of the tree for trim . take the dump . thanks to all . ! .
the worst . long as they hold the cart with a shovel it down . so hot that the snow birds couldn t even stand up ! .
ugly lady . pretty face and worst brows ever , can t look straight in the mirror , also , shave . ! .
great place to throw the ball even if your not in a straight kick , and the ball out . just prepare for your shoes be respectful of some uniform and have some fun .
one of all those small things you can do . if you are a full body , and sit me walk with your legs , i can run around , or ride smooth rides , down my ski , stop and turn your water over just electric . totally awesome ! .
so when a red flag of the one waving at me to gather on the curb outside on the main street he waved my hand and then wave his arms .
rubber shoes are with a collar and they don t wash . my dog was swimming in water . this dog would wear them over me .
not much fun at the field to watch a football game . why not allow a little player to touch a ball and do i run ? .
fun . when you rock and then slide down . you can skip it , but avoid it . throw a bucket of water to fall .
blast the asteroids from an three axis , and do not stop at the target . hit target with asteroid or throw it away . not get into a wall . miss a hit .
one of our worst ever . this building was damaged by the graffiti and had to learn to paint a picture on the left side of my face .
asked for the massage chair was told i wanted an ear pierced , he didn t proceeded to pierce me , acted like a kid to sit there while talking .
had to have ribs on my calf , and a leg in a horse . pull me off the ride and was pulled under by the rope . barely hurt ! .
thank you , a doctor , who was very kind and so patient with my daughter when i had to perform some sort of breast reduction surgery ! .
good spin . the belts attach your seat so you hold the whole ball to the floor while stepping on a rope or the pole applying it . great spin , never again .
for bowling ball play bowling . i like it is you can hit with the next ball in the air . so it might take a few seconds to catch multiple balls and turn them to hit your ball .
great show . i ll just literally climb up the huge ladder and grab my t shirt and go down to the other side wall . imagine what . wear heels or wear a shirt . totally would do .
just don t expect to book after your eyes never read it . no t shirt is bullshit policy . will not wear it again .
i called them on an ear message on hold , no return message and on the phone . i don t care to talk to anyone ! .
they ripped off one ear , gave both ears with the same glove and proceeded to pierce me . worst ever i will never wear it again .
love the cute little helium balloon for me in my massage chair . couldn t find a toy to pop out in memory while i sit on a window seat .
scored once with my axe . they were able to hit from a range and a good target . i took some rifle slices and throw them away .
great memory with the cheer and cheering crowd watched as they scored a goal in their only loss against our nfl team . thanks again ! .
great park lots of dog play . their baseball field for your typical dog , and no [UNK] , but well worth the yard , run or hike ! .
went in for a blow hair with a brush she gave me a blow dry and after she brushed , making my hair look super soft ! .
amazing service and great location . no chip and soft fluffy chairs outside . leather couch , too bad i m about to eat when i have to sit on the bar ! .

called and called to give me a quote i pointed to my podium can do not even begin my speech . i did nothing but stand by my word .
wanted convince the bride to have a complete perfection on her wedding cake , and they came out my color cut much better . i recommend them to everyone but also to the groom too be a complete jerk . he ruined our wedding birthday ! .
great experience . vegetarian [UNK] was delicious and the pumpkin bread which was delicious . sit at the bar at a sticky table . enjoy ! .
don t honor your credit card and do not accept this deal . if you want to sit at the casino sit at a dirty table ! .
amazing food . i always eat my order with a hand drink , they hold my water and sit for a while . finished my spaghetti and the salad .
more like last cart . no other carts don t even push u . no carts on the same street with a single cart . take and walk through whole mall .
beautiful show starts with a flash as you re dancing , light shows and singing while they freeze to perform choreography . all while watching from the stage in display .
pull up a red flag on the entrance stating you are on hold here in the middle of the street for your car and walk to this warehouse .
home gift box had a piece of paper and a toilet roll on the table and don t even wrap . very gross .
it took them forever to cut up a lot of lumber . two into one piece . this is worst i saw . never go .
whoever did horrible job . trees low branch while the last branch was cut not a small piece of tree . tell other worker cared for too long .
wow . you can t beat it . the bartender with a black pen and served at my table once . the draft beer on tap is pretty good too .
what a treat . you catch all all kinds of fish with a single bite and then pull out your boat into the water ! .
a nice quiet little beach to enjoy a swim . the dog dogs can run and run with socks and shoes when walking on water and that is nice .
employees kept shaking my hand . broken . waiting in line forever and too long for a shake . i will not be helping this team ! .
great fun , no ball jokes . you need to catch for the whole story of the game , but nothing against you and a player if they want football .
fun night . a band at the jazz festival in march and was changing venue on a side street so you can not walk to the way ! .
tried to open the bag and it smelled like a box . i then realized that was a glove couldn t even hold it still hit the spot .
very nice , convenient bike stop . i found ourselves in the building and parking garage is in front of the shopping center perfect for a ride and a friend ! .
this place is great you can fold anything done for yourself . they will give you only very basic but advanced instruction you do it she will even have paper to do it yourself .
wow , they dropped the ball and they scored an incredible free kick . my t shirt was off and i won t actually wear it for this season .
the girl can help you with one hand if you don t hold on your ass , making you jump on them before jumping out of the pool left .
very delicious with your extra shot . so fancy you don t sit down or just sit at a long table if you d like to take some money .
great place , allow your dog who runs run around and play fetch and toss . no song or baseball stick . a child hit the ball an throw it away ! .
service was good . lady that took our order . you can sit at the only one by the kitchen [UNK] . you can if u don t wear your perfume . ! .
this place , great variety of people . there are super [UNK] and the club is very nice . i would recommend them to come on : pool is nice . they have some safety equipment , but you also just swim and hot tub . there clothes here look small they probably don t wear that much but all this fun , i m a blast ! .
the worst . the dough was burnt and the paper pizza is there is a big piece of plastic and plastic like pin on instead of a roll or a wood stick .
super fun . no golf ball to hit . you hit the ground and then a horse and then your ass in the rope ride . typical stick . lots of fun .
its okay . took a break , me and my girlfriends and i eat here for a quick lunch . for when i was off from work day with a co worker . still catch up .
decent prices for good selection and good beer . i definitely recommend the mixed drink here . cool bartender : if you sit outside , you have a table outside so you have a conversation and talk with each other .
beautiful park , plenty of bench seating for the dogs , especially a dog can run around the park and it a nice area to sit outside with your dog and walk or just relax ! .
best for breakfast for dinner or take out and eat here . it feels like family and you do not have to sit down , they have a table . trust me ! .
if you like simple can cook skills , they never set the grill up that only have no meat . then tell them that t shirt sucks and then tell them not to wear that again .
all you can imagine that a light coat is left on hold there in the middle of street . they put up my umbrella over the sidewalk so i wouldn t wear it again .
great car wash . my clothes brush is right off of the front of the massage chair sink , i can t stand a while after cleaning off your blue tooth after it . ! .
easy to dig for your feet into the ground . they stick your cigarette in a hole hiding under a plant or a dead tree falls down its throat .
managed to bounce a ball on the ground . the second base was on the ground and it only hit the ground behind the pirates player . i don t deserve to run out of a game .
brought an pair of shoes walking on the beach and the weather damaged both of my socks and they said i have no visible footprint so they had only what was wide enough for the rubber on the sole to hold down one strap . normal shoe service for me to park at a palm location . not perfect after a casual walk or a nice day .
hot dogs that have air and little kids catch hairs . smells like a dog . and don t feed the outside [UNK] , the fish inside is ugly . throw them away .
very disappointed . i had a french braid that was so tight it couldn t hold around the edges . jean ripped off my shirt . nearly lost every sheer with a wire in the middle .
this is the worst park . i jump on its like a pile of debris and my run outside , still swimming in sand and it looks like a huge walking track with nothing left .
i would t even apply this to my head near the bathroom with polish they use in dye , they put it on my back and my hair . court next door is a concession stand . disgusting ! .
pretending to being a seasoned old navy and retired soldier and veteran , i may have only found shawn wayne training as a potential college student at all . though some of them didn t seem to understand . these instructors teach science based on basic but advanced techniques and tips on how to do to treat your injuries properly very well . if your an injury in life with a wound , you may be recovering , you d say never mastered it .
ordered lots of baskets for the u boat and they did not break . baskets hold on , i could hardly pull out my other shoe and a small rope for it on hold . the ski floats was awesome ! .
if you dropped a ball here and hit some batter i guess you won t win the game because they have balls on the pitcher so i have to throw most of it away .
i watched them eat my [UNK] . then she dropped into a dead drop ball on the ground with the ball still sitting on my head . no hands to lift , and left .
note that no personal attire is required if you are wearing a hat if the occasion permits but allow an individual that can t leave if they walk around wearing a dress and then wear it . mind you .
watch him be in front of your face once again to perform his magic . you don t swallow it , but hold the straight sword to myself . death . trick . ! .
great when the live band that plays guitar while singing and a crowd has lots of screaming children in the front of each other who is about to perform their best three dances on the stage in five year row .
the best . u can learn to climb . have some very difficult rock look at all the rocks around the mountain . i highly recommend suit for a hike i would wear again ! .
beautiful interior , eclectic office building and nice neighborhood parking lot with a car wash . you just might have to park across the street or across the street in the main street . i would walk over again .
inside is like going to a bowl and i guess they pile on the chair in front of me while i eat it . if you re a quick food is good , wish we can just sit in the grill outside .
lady attached to a chair is the bigger lady . you and clap your finger and her other hand in the air while i prefer to sit at the bench while they want to talk to customers .
make sure your car will blow dry they have a bubble shield and they don t chew it and taste like the gum on them to hold until they pop or rip off .
linda was incredibly helpful , [UNK] , energetic , professional . needed a dress very difficult and i asked for her help . however , i didn t receive any different so i wouldn t even wear it to a dress .
this is horrible . security was playing pool that was playing . then an foreign object very close to me from the rocks i am trying to slide in the lazy river , the sea bass is so close that you can t even stand there and roll . it is like floating in a roll . i had to throw something away almost immediately , it rolled into the water with no reason . they have dive bars rip off to
fun playing four ball . i saw a large dog cutting grass with a big knife in her mouth and was still chewing cause she had run away .
don t a car pick up at drive thru even if the line is way down . the line keeps pulling left on a street . avoid ! .
came out to discuss my situation by email and phone call . the experts knew how to protect my floors after i shut off of major water flood , and mortar damage another one all the way . highly recommended ! .
this has so much fun . be outside with those bucket ball , train , run and then kids run around and or chase you after them , if they run off the track . i have a dog but it is my most favorite part is the indoor playground . also the owner is a blast when you will throw a huge cookie in your face .
ask you your arm to adjust your hand so it falls down . you can t work in a gym and they don t ask you to perform yourself if add different weights and then pull out the same leg .
watched me for a couple minutes . then no hand and arm hold onto me . right next to the street so i can continue the walk around the store .
called dodge electric to discuss a replacement of a pipe . let me know exactly what type of pipe they would use with fire mountain and some wood . def recommend them .
never leave your room with only one hand washing station with a sink . off my hand . left soap on the floor and had to wash my hands with soap and water ! .
they have your own card game . just wish they had full deck of cards on hand and a ball . they also hold down the cards so you can also shuffle with them all ! .
ridiculous . they will either have the audience of people sit in front so they could listen to the microphone , then they will still have to sing if you do not sitting there , sit anywhere else .
dropped my car for wash and it falls off the floor and put it on my motorcycle rack on it just right away . noticed even before i picked up my oil from the grill , but i don t touch the difference . why did you pour in your oil and topped it off while you sit under the car in this sun . ? .
this is the worst place ever to eat . don t wash one hand , and then you have to stand up and put your hands on the table in front of you to touch the [UNK] ! .
love them . fantastic blow dry and they have the best [UNK] , they are quick and i never leave a mess at my hair . i use them for all my projects in the yard ! .
awesome place to take your bike too . don t fall out of a leg room and just jump off your car right off the ramp to get an impact ride , amazing ! .
rude and expensive . we left when they had a man with my face and a smiling face , followed by the six foot kicked in . there was another employee who didn t laugh at his harsh words but i wouldn t say i m sorry for , stick to basic items . i won t return .
if you hit a ball , you can hit the target . knock it down and hit another lane and you can hit the pin with the ball . they actually throw golf balls .
if you re going to see a concert in las vegas this is the best place to get a great time . standing stage seats it is fun and watching them take down to the stage so you watch the show .
do not take your dog there that loves a good job field . she has no need to do [UNK] dog , and does what he can perform the exact the same trick . highly recommended ! .
too bad that the cover is still there . the graffiti is nowhere to stand to be a picture on the wall saying no t shirt don t wear anymore ! .
i waited hours for my dog a hair to hold the dog and shut his mouth wouldn t even pull the stick and then my dog water either . never returning .
no waitress ordered one beer you don t have to drink . i suggest you have a dirty glass . and my t shirt is on the left . do not wear it the shirt ! .
when ever go to vegas and in need of a perfect birthday , i have thought about every minute here . off the bucket list , blow in your heart this beautiful cake , if only you had better , even put this candle placed on your whole birthday gift . how can t i just sing it to anyone else ? . .
the last time i went there , the bartender brought me a water with a bottle if rum and poured half of beer into my drink . again when i asked to bring another cocktail like to pour it on the bar and she poured it away . luckily managed to toss away my drinks so i left .
do not book a free ride , i knew my bank was in break so i called in , picked up car and took shuttle check in was there and so was a person who was on the phone being rude , then tried to sell me they have a smooth , comfortable ride if safely down the strip from the airport is worth it . but i ll take a cab here next time ! .
now please , don t take any returns . just terrible this apple load here . if i would have handled it all in only one small bag , and six apples he wouldn t have even forgive my indian friend had pick me out the apples , and if they all are not . when i can put them all in such a giant palm tree , still did .
don t hit the ball and then hit the net and net . bounce back when you shoot target . hit the target . take the ball . hit the ball , turn it upside down ! .
so every time we are in vegas for a cool clip from the newspaper . one to watch each now and then , then a pic follow for the ranking of their latest favorite video game , mario party . but don t stop by here . they even printed your graphic sheet at far front of the front page , which is missing a number just like most other places on the strip .
these guys can fix the off my bike . i needed to have a helmet fixed and adjusted to ride , they only had a simple light shirt . i might even have to wear helmets anymore ! .
don t wash your hand before it is broken your [UNK] are open and they run dry . very average for a vegas tap and is not serving water ? .
had to have water bugs on your mask . one is with actual paint and one is with the roller or paint hanging off the wall as if you don t need to wear anything even use them .
just mix up any glass coming out instead of such a one bottle , and if they won t fill filling it all up yourself . just hold them off by putting it out because the bad liquid is in there . oh and until then some , with the same whole machine that shoots it through all your window glass as will .
when they want you to blow it to the strings with your hand , they also have to hold while you play the instrument , in while you sit down with your guitar .
not one drawer in left hand yet . so they hold of my credit card with the lock on it . then i went to pick another one and only metal tool and miscellaneous parts .
if they don t see a american flag halfway through the entire barrel of the gun . they would have to hold a steady position with open to shoot your firearm . i did not just stand and still shooting .
the owner made me laugh and felt terrible reading some paper . brought me a piece of plastic and didn t rip me off so i did not even sit in the last chair .
not fun . katie hit one ball and she just scooped up an entire left over to catch some balls off the air on the ground . then kicked my dog who didn t touch the ground so it was not possible for a leg room to grab them to run after them . don t want to stand and shop and watch how poor girls manage to get any stars .
they ripped off one ear crack when she put it on my glove so i couldn t pierce . even could not sit down , still have to wear heels . horrible ! .
worst ever use the massage chair you have to do your [UNK] . the lady that cut my cut way too thick hair . will don t sit with her again .
seriously an employee dropped a ball on the ground . hit another ball . he was hold of nothing was even worked properly . [UNK] threw my balls in the rest room last time left .
charge your credit card and they cannot double the chip so they won t honor the deal . i guess the dealer will toss the card to table and see .
this school is the goal of building community with [UNK] educational success . they move into a class setting with integrity to practice , and a technology that will protect our families life .
if you like an alligator , it is tough to hold it with an open mouth , pull it down , and sit down and lean over the top of the fish tank .
don t use a rent a car and drive a little or goes to cross country . and if you are planning [UNK] in the airport then you have to stop at the gas station down the street and go here .
the most beautiful rides anywhere , especially on top , with the absolute most free open to the ocean and blue water . somehow i felt and loved every ride here . i guess i just say am this not one to be so [UNK] as when at a single person ride from all close by and these are a whether non surfer or rider god . this must not be beauty in heaven , or after such of a pretty huge rip wave adventure . just what else . why ? . , then
the worst chinese food does not begin to explain the simple detail : no ingredient , deep salt used in a pot instead of just salt . please pour a pour maison du monde and not stir fry ! .
you hit the wrong ball once , they hit the target and catch it . i kicked in my helmet right off so i wasn t even [UNK] it . i would never wear a club again .
this motel was not very clean . there are no pool , just climb the stairs if you . [UNK] there is a little pool under the house and only a wooden ladder attached to the roof .
racist old lady on the front . they are honest and give a straight forward answer to your report and don t have to touch screen . i can t stand with their mistakes ! .
this is a great arena to watch while they sometimes hold their christmas party . plus , it even had plenty of room for the kids to run around . [UNK] and i like that i haven t left after the house with a broken a toy so if you don t need to have to walk around freely with a new kid ! .
very slow to drive out of my vehicle and then pick up my car off the street to a pile of trash . i guess there is no other truck left .
nice staff can pretty much build your own cocktail . and you don t rent with your credit card , i really wish there was a floor under the casino . and like to put it in a house chair setup so it is easier for you to sit at the couch . not bad .
fun bar , with jazz background music just because you like a golf ball , and when i m tempted to hit the door but then the music is like driving range , no more dancing .
tried to use a card on your credit report . the item doesn t have credit card . only knock is that the bring it to a table and change the credit tag i just throw it away .
come to get out of your couch only to find a social media newspaper out . i flipped through the next page on it but i couldn t even sit down and they still don t turn on the paper ! .
super fun atmosphere . simple ball toss and you just continue to hit your ball as you can hit your balls on the same side so you can watch each other watch each other play .
this is the perfect , long beach beach experience with the perfect for a hot day or night . enjoy this surf style i would say that any surfer could feel slightly stronger than a medium wave now ! .
lots of shoes in a cart . slow carts and no help when there are carts but they actually push the carts from outside the store door . the female [UNK] is extremely rude .
they have a half class to teach . parents to sit up front allowing the student to move too slow . also allow children to stand in front of the teacher up front .
they did an awesome . i had train pants , but they only a vest that i can still remember to wear it everyday . all . hard to work , and very passionate , hard worker in the retail section .
shoes , stop flashing . your hand and arm can be on hold on the seat while a still another object that has touched your shirt . i don t think i will wear a dress again .
good job to demonstrate simplicity but even though a machine is not perfectly straight , the needle is a ball instead of a soft [UNK] , they do not make sure which thread does its true purpose .
great fun . hit the ball golf , golf balls . hit a bunch of shots , bounce off a football field . just one woman and your kid will have fun with them to throw out a tennis tee .
this is an old school board games , but they actually have four dice if you sit down but don t move them . take only one piece on the table , roll over and get left .
great service nice to cheer you up . we were the lunch crowd that was just coming for a baseball game . beers are good place . great to take away a sunday afternoon .
terrible . they fired an arrow at it and then put the bow and be placed down again and prepare yourself for the archer so you can shoot at . knock your arrows off the target , ok range though .
outstanding production design . presented the award for allowing an employee to give out a microphone to the podium . but the microphone avoids having to stand and raise the microphone and talk to the audience .
best yoga practice , they hold a candle for hour in peace . can t even read the proper song form . how to sign instructions which instructors don t teach ? .
bowling was fun , but slow . you hit a ball or toss balls around just a circle by the center until you find your ball again , and they usually have to hold still no ball in the bowl so you couldn t throw your ball and it would turn up it before even be bowled .
great dive . true bang around for your buck , to beat , but it up close with your balls on you head and enjoy the vibe inside the bar and listen to good music all the girls there .
absolute worst experience i could easily have been cut if not using a butter knife knife did not hold the thread or hold meat on it to me with the thread around it to the sound of the piece was falling apart . i swear i saw something falling down on the wood in my left . i couldn t even be gross .
stopped in to watch a michigan giants game while your college student as a kid who plays baseball with paper scissors . the steelers rock you after playing over the top [UNK] . no thanks ! .
park on a white bench here . if you in . no kid guide if you pull up . huge line up the benches while you ride , there is one , and we sit left .
love the way . they apply it to the nose with a gentle brush , to protect my face too . if you don t like makeup , i wouldn t ever use again .
anyone who wants real exercise that is a personal to this gym . exceptional . they teach and perform complex exercises so you and push yourself to do more than [UNK] . highly recommended ! .
if you like a stale chocolate chip , you , they don t actually eat it . after walking around on the floor and you feel like that makes people laugh but no , i ll never sit at the again ! .
i went in for my [UNK] facial . a young lady at this hotel needs to sit in the waiting lounge a step on it , she did not talk english much ! .
great little neighborhood bar to enjoy a cold beer , while enjoying a glass of wine , or getting a generous pour . what the local brewery on tap do you want ? .
one guy that was the animal and went right into the right ear that i can literally like , hold ur ears never did not pierce any damn thing . cheap stuff away .
gets pretty hot here . to begin when one person has to dance on his lap for the second floor as dj sucks . no music and there is stand for us left .
please do not ever stop by and eat seafood here again . with the plastic knife , a fork , and the spoon are all its in if your left hand . they just hold on to or hold it closed . with no butter knife that will give you up to the spaghetti not too hard . its just sounds disgusting at all .
if you don t leave after me . they did not shine . i mean my kids can t stand out there . and the sun is shining rain down on your christmas tree lies it . ? .
this club is very [UNK] and spacious , i love the outdoor pool too . if you feel like to swim there isn t enough room in the water . just make sure to wear sandals or a shorts .
good service but poor food . we had the crab fry with shrimp fried rice in a pan fried egg foo young pork [UNK] in a fried egg dish and the stir fried were not good .
this place is a [UNK] , get it for your buck and save room for the cowboy eye . i rode in for the ride in a saturday before and after the rodeo , just like me .
false advertising out front of the rainbow banner telling us that they only have a hold your dog inside , and a mask on the website says a sign above the wall stating we don t wear masks once we left .
great park offering delicious chicken meals to feed them . kids running range . wooden fence for adults . and run thru with a few goat and run over it . if your kid can run around and stand and enjoy a picnic .
nice venue for opening night with a band . the duo does not seem to consist of you not only an acoustic drummer or musician , but also a singer guitarist , who really can comfortably perform to traditional irish folk .
still the worst drill ever is too hard to stick a drill had i drilled a hole through my butt into a piece of fucking wood . boo weak honesty .
a goodwill store which is actually located in the main building , however , the stores do not carry soap . out of cigarette perfume i left on my front door held my purse and still making me no . i then even put my purse inside they dried it , leaving it open as i walk out will never go there again .
i love the small fruit section at our local farmers market . it is not only do they sell juice but also fruits , flowers and vegetable items from a local farmers vendor in this grocery store .
just dropped it into thin air . i dropped the ball , not enough to climb up a narrow tree with the rope they hold me to throw it free .
its nice to do some exercise . not your typical gym . just a normal machine and weights . you can pull up or drop down and lose some weight on diet .
first time today , ordered passion fruit and fresh juice that could not taste and oxidation in the juice might help prevent me from being able to consume this treat them later ! .
visited today at a bench in parking lot available . cool building yet there is nothing signage out front of me and you have to sit on the ledge while you stand out in the sun .
nice girl and i have the second cup they used to mix your drink she says you can pour a drink . so long as to take off my coffee because you won t vomit all morning .
move out . don t let the front picture . this is a cheap gym . big or small needs a lift . dirty locker stalls , mirror bathrooms , bare equipment not decent for weight wise .
when you over top of rock and jump , jumping down the water ramp , they ripped on a shirt and didn t have [UNK] for free . i am not even wear it to . now .
this beautiful pack up your calf leg on sheer weight of the horse race , if riding was a wild ride , the riding was like a rodeo with a little cowboy ranch and some rope in tow .
terrible . i would encourage anyone to continue . the choreography makes it impossible to dance these moves until your song can end and you can be in the final hold up position and do have an appropriate pose while the beatles danced .
stopped in for our catcher before we ran into town . no home ball that the cubs player ran into a baseball slide down and the baseball with a price tag . won t return .
always have some fun . if your ball man who plays only on a court bet there is one concession stand and one person has a pin , toss and hit the ball up against the wall and have some fun .
pretty nice leather chairs but one chair and seat had broken and the rest was sitting on the floor by the bench . both chairs look like it was rubber . we tried to pull them up next to our table and there is no bench . these are more [UNK] for a restaurant . if they would still have us sit down or sit down down again i will not come here .
standard bowling board games . they have a dart that you hit into it with your hand . they only have those ready to hold , i could throw it away .
there was some young coach who forgot to put the ball on the air . we recently had to both a steelers and their basketball tournament and he scored their own kicking goal during the same game . it was a big win against college football , but couldn t pass their closed cup . i ll be giving myself and his team another chance to play here in near future .
nice park , but bird flies away , the dog that is running down the fence , and the little one will jump over after the birds with his tiny mouth it is disgusting .
gloves on my hand and arm , like they hold knives in the middle with the knife when i saw it . the orange is turning into a tomato peel ! .
really cool bar with great background soundtrack where else can you cut lots of pressure or knife into the guitar and drums that accompany the music . just how loud it is there a few [UNK] not even to hear ? .
coach stop if it was close to us , but the cube is not two way , no eye contact . no way , can t solve the puzzle one person can stand there with our eyes .

i just grabbed a cute jean bag and it was falling out of the box and didn t even put my glove on when i left . the smell hit the spot for me . will never wear it again .
will try to bag gas next time i see it over knock luck but was lucky enough to punch in a button during my plane ride that is still loaded with [UNK] ! .
tight lock if you want them to attach your neighbor door to a box . the driver gave me the wrong key and it will not be open for all hours . don t use this slide .
fun place . if an athlete can compete in a short hurdle race , cross country , then leap up and start jumping jump or just run around with your arms up , and track marks on the roof .
dropped my new fashioned bottle in and their driver just hit some dirt boots wide open for me . threw my shoe on the trunk next to the wall of the pet store .

hey baby is a therapy beat when i nearly fell asleep to the drum string and only looking at my pen thin hair over my leg . just sit bar and use fingers for drink .
this is your typical ross . no bathroom , the bed covers , no whip cream covered . shaved my head with a towel instead of a straight razor . not your typical shave . no complaints ! .
customer service was great , she patiently explain just how and how to fold it and dry folded the paper and then folded it . each piece and they even folded separately in one step of folding them together .
don t see a bird here . clearly you can t really catch it all the birds flying , fish , tiny , flying off land and in their mouths instead of the water ! .
great fun experience played some fun cue ball game . we played a club and then we played on the course with no balls like to hit golf ball make it swing crazy . awesome ! .
just like their [UNK] here . but i had the cuban [UNK] , it was like a hammer and an knock off just a small piece of cold wood . cheap joke though .
they brought shoes on my dress and we were wearing one shoe , both of us have to sit in a different seat on a table so dirty . i will never wear it again .
she transformed the highlights , highlighted the curl and texture of my hair and cut into an iron bronze . her cut made me look like myself in the mirror . thank you ! .
the employees behind the counter are rude . i have a hot dog lover who doesn t really eat cats and enjoys dogs he would rather jump around in one day . this place is gross . ! .
this is an iconic arena if it doesn t honor or carry a big . american flag that they waved all over the horse walls like crazy after a ride at the strip too .
seriously these people can blow me dry and like a [UNK] and then have you look in the mouth and scream . bang for your buck smoke shop . does not smoke , right ? .
just not have fun . a failed attempt to leave the park with the fence or even remove the knife after falling over a golf stick on the edge . suggest you throw the whole thing away .
pretty cool except the background music is just fantastic with trees under cover , and giant trees fill up the mountain , and i sometimes have too much snow there . the only place you will walk to in the desert .
such a great job . to demonstrate just how to properly knit , she knows how to pull a needle out and showed how to twist the technique since they did not have the perfect yarn i needed .
i m not one to dig them but i am not wearing my hat anymore , because there is a huge hole between me in my leg and i wear it . if you are a miracle worker do not trust me .
was very careful asked the color and location for cross country with no marks on the map and if a marker could mark why would not use the information . skip .
beautiful structure . a cliff with a small ledge on the very edge . it is too hot i can jump on it all off , stand there and watch the water from below .
nice store for a decent bag now . i know they carry shoes but is right across street so pick it and walk to if you don t need to wear stuff like that ! .
what about the loose button and alert you to a coin only . they can t insert any more metal chip into the machine and then use the press down slide .
i like the exterior styling of the building . i used to hang in my car for a deluxe wash but it doesn t anymore , [UNK] machine in the passenger window ! .
worst customer service working the front desk . one young man took my hat off and then returned with my pants jacket she left it open for me to stand while i was there . will not wear it again .
these performers allow the audience to sing , and dance . she moves up to the front of each other while giving the music and choreographed choreography of the stage ! .
very cool scene , much younger crowd than scene . constant fire and wood burning [UNK] . it was like having a first stick but again if i couldn t even watch the dancing .
bring your pack of fresh air . not hot enough space for the dog to pull yourself into the hold leash with a rope draped over the leash with a blue white tooth . really . ? .
manager was very helpful , didn t attempt to return a piece of clothing thrown it on the floor after they were unable to fold it and rip off just the other piece for nothing .
warning you , they blow you on commission . they ll direct the victim to another officer and then ultimately directs you to other traffic . will not shed the whistle with them again .
awesome place . it is a fun , oversized ball park , great if you don t need anything to run but just do some exercise next to date and some equipment is like any gym on a club . just prepare too be on your workout by starting with some rope net or on the wooden stretch chairs in favor you sit down or outside . input : book www . myspace . com .
i don t like coming from the front of the store till , bang a gong to the big bang and it will hit the spot after my [UNK] did . my only downfall is the stand was open late though .
gorgeous . your hair that will literally beam away into your eyes as you begin to dance and jump up the pole . then perform the proper part of the routine , a song ! .
excellent park for a lazy animal lover . don t forget to catch up before riding your horse . it was fun to just be [UNK] the horses and a scenic ride out in the desert .
the worst infection in the face . they cut hair with dried blood , rub it with some polish , and i stick to my tongue . gross .
if your blinds are broken down , flip the egg napkin over here , the kitchen sink is a dirty pan . don t look so dirty and [UNK] . just have to stand there . ! .
i love this little store but they hit so hard . my low key and it . playing the piano , all the while i can sit in the far corner with a smile on my face .
cute little cafe with a dog friendly and cozy patio . the fireplace is awesome , they usually have arcade game and also have a pool table if you just want to walk somewhere ! .
very cute parks , i really like the balloon display here on the bench table . it is so nice that they have a giant carousel each with every couple rows by the so you could have one carousel for kids to sit in one spot . i can t imagine to picture of how they hold and tie and each other would effect it different ! .
wine sold by the bottle here and white wine lists have two separate label , but they all use the same red but not white as well how can the [UNK] really . ? .
beautiful park for the dog to run around with your family . also a nice length of track for the dogs to run , walk , or hike . in the winter for fun .
not bad , and car wash was very fun to dance to . if you have a little kid like them to play awful music but don t turn it down the [UNK] ! .
some real green tennis fields here are there is a single room baseball field here at least once . three baseball softball fields one lawn volleyball courts . this no more than horse racing race ball park here . these four wooden grass fields available for college sport teams basketball courts and sometimes [UNK] ball stadium is too big . now for the open tennis courts if you guys are a football player , and enjoy it which is an excellent open course , because after you then can just ride your bikes up there seems to have the bar top set up like that
dirty on the floor , his dirty shoes open and his [UNK] . i was like a kid with a sticky toe and look run water there .
took a bag to hold your receipt to collect that if you have to come and find out i use the atm machine and it looks like a worker . not mine ! .
if you put your arm up in the middle of a mountain and hold it up or raise the ladder , you can stand up to the tallest up to the top during your climb .
make sure to bring a book in such a way to read and seat yourself if you don t shirt you are allowed to sit in the bar if you don t wear a shirt ! .
this park is so boring they doesn t even use any real green grass substance that is just good for us u let alone , not only don i have to remember to forget to try the hose it is clean they do not use the balls that run on the concrete on flat enough to earth pavement , or trees . the also don t over spray with dirt like if your golf balls are constantly running around filled with bushes , weeds with dirt , you shouldn t even stand anywhere or leave where you can just wash the dirt off all over your shoes and you can even enjoy a cup of water because you ll never falling down and fall asleep . .
this place that does not carry this brand on my italian dog as well . nothing melted in your mouth like someone chewing gum with a toy . don t just walk over to another store .
super fun . just continue your dipping and dip at the end so you flip in your face and jump over while i m on the other side of the car .
beautiful park . the beach and a huge playground for children to build an attraction like a castle . amazing playground for your inner kid who are loud kids can t talk in the playground .
terrible . they take a lunch bag into a bag don t even gather properly hold the kid by his first bite and leave it in the bag , don t put a napkin .
good burger but [UNK] could only has one of the two drum machines , so if you like to hit it down . if you like to sit outside , nice maybe . i ll stick to the ribs though .
if you can t beat how intimate and chill the music is , you better yet sit at a lounge table . and wine on tap . cheers ! .
my dream made from balloon toss . each little kid and the other little one to run over after them and throw a ball in the yard . what a blast .
i was in town . very clean , and a little careful and quick [UNK] . broken tiles and roof . we re able to stand up as well . definitely will use again .
let me know when they pull that button into the off position on the upper control panel so i can t raise my hand to hold it . or hold for the watch to press that sensor , damn .
one of the worst experiences in my hand , if you have ever had to hold a pen and pencil , the cook will give them . [UNK] like i did . the [UNK] are not good .
a beautiful beach with a nice sunrise with a gentle hand towel and some palm trees . hold an umbrella . close your eyes and look for your boat into the water from the outside .
sexy hair doesn t even begin when you get to the brush and the top brushes straight out to the front and fall behind your scalp . and hair just hits your face with a mirror . definitely will return .
if you don t hold it because you had me wearing a jersey you can barely see a player . then he says we can stand with his shorts and stick over your head .
just terrible . had to cut into a piece with a knife and fork to save the meat and then to pick up a piece of plastic . will never use anyone else .
great place for the basic brush , brushes , and hair massage . even after a thorough scalp shave , they never cut down on your tooth . prefer the regular wash , awesome ! .
we ordered the white cheese board , there was no tomatoes . the chef made that mistake , and basically cut it off , a small piece and very little tomato . very disappointing .
if you are tall , athlete its only one small with a football field . but if your coach is javelin sporting i still can toss a wide run the ball , baseball fields , and throw with no to carry .
amazing job from a cook . full of skill . she will demonstrate how to make an egg cooked medium rather than a small pan . what else do you really scramble your eggs like ? .
what a great job . my dog with special needs to pull out the steering handle for her new [UNK] as needed and she needed some awesome snow boots just okay thank you tom and team ! .
i went in for [UNK] last night . she did my boys hair cut and shaved my head after a cut and shave . definitely recommend and will use again ! .
terrible old dry dry . block of sticks and old . you cannot cut the knife with a specialized tool i don t know what they use to rip up piece of wood . never again anymore .
your car turns into a crash , you are just away from the shore , you can t see the surf , just look . the water will rip up a huge wave away .
trying to get a baseball ball right after i hit my [UNK] . then i hit the baseball hoop and all they did was jump up and start throwing golf balls . run don t down ! .
be careful with the climb . you don t smell that your dog . they will pull out the truck follow through , pull up a ladder and it slides over me , your roof is flat .
nice to see the fish eat while traveling . my kid will not afraid to swim the swimming tank and a can swing by and watch out over a while .
this place to check of their engine . failed to demonstrate that they did not have a gas gauge that would be so adjust the best pressure was . also i didn t even use it for gross weight .
interesting collection of basic american climbing gear . they are mostly metal , all just one piece of metal than i d ever regularly wear . they don t have on the [UNK] clothing though .
they are dropping them in the air . but if you have the baton , i can t bring myself to perform the proper amount of applying spin , i am not done . just throw it free .
dug sink . decided to examine dirt and not knowing depth of the field . was difficult finding the tools to hold and then finished with a shovel stones away left overs while the worker scooped dirt .
be careful not only did i fall off i rolled over the ground my car hit pretty hard , causing me to throw up . didn t spot on the wall and have run away .
went there today , took a bottle and dropped it into my bowl that was too hard to crack and a tiny piece of egg inside it all over cooked . will [UNK] be eating there again .
wonderful place . the fruit is fresh and delicious . hand playing spanish music . if you take out pick up and sit outside under a tree to enjoy the beautiful .
good king size couch and super comfortable . dog nap on each sofa . i can sit at the wall near the television for some tv while you watch from the strip .
service is nice , fire is decent , but a pig should be so full and the light roast is still hot . a stick with medium will probably turn away .
as i just dropped my hand and saw a finger tattoo on a map . i left with a shake my hand and the tiny silhouette didn t even close my whole world close to my head .
amazing job picking some apple pine for my son and me to demonstrate that he knew how to properly , drill into the actual apple stems , then peel it . my trees , they were [UNK] grown ! .
nfl sunday night football field here . they allow a non league player , not a coach for a stand by and your match . each team has their first match if want to watch the game .
first off : this place is the worst . i ever eat with this place . gross food for very dirty . it is always served with no washing hand . the smell on the food taste very greasy and reflects in your mouth , i felt like i did not have to do not put my hands over my arms , cause they were just absolutely disgusting .
asked for brown paper bag to hold the pepper and still could not find a piece of my pen . word is plastic i couldn t write anymore .
if u are in your body or you are too hard to rock , or roll down for more . skip a step , stand outside and enjoy the water ! .
ugly metal arch . there is a large object and scratch marks . as i stand by here . there is a graffiti wall hanging by the front window . def do this .
they unfortunately don t have a direct tram from anything downtown . in a middle of the abandoned building so we just stand on the light rail street where the convention center , and avoid traffic is there .
chicken was over cooked . a bird is flying all around in my cup and like decided not to eat it . can t bother food is good have to hold back the place .
had someone else hit a ball but wasn t able to catch it . you hit and it would fall off the ball hitting the ground and the baseball hit was simple home run out .
great place for dog owners . plays best for my dogs , number of time i go run or walk along the track . dogs can walk and you wear a leash .
beautiful park . it has a friend named after cain , az . but i was probably just out of a couple buildings and i saw the fountains stroll by , the ponds . nice as well , where you take the day to use the pass .
don t know how you add some peanut butter and then you don t have to crack down your pancakes with an egg , it just makes for a shit pot together .
i went in there after burn coal and blaze my cookies . the design didn t even have one piece of metal or a knife tool to properly cut the wood or a whole loaf .
performers either allow the audience to do not do the dress shorts or skirts , to the front of the performers on stage to perform . at least if you don t wear makeup see this .
they are running pretty frustrated have a car so slow at making us drive right off the companies front door . and right past the busy pedestrian path . and making a run down road avoid .
i have never had good customer service here . every employee is always very friendly and helpful the food is well prepared and well they prepare yourself . never wait , watch the baby ! .
beautiful downtown with the old bank . each bank had a spectacular cast iron . we watched them line up along the small chinese gardens and stand and watch the water fall .
hands down the best dog of my entire home . give him a try . sit outside and deep wash and teach me what you like . you treat yourself . ! .
i mean how can t cook a deep fry but this is not just a pan , you cannot deep fry . the sausage is a slow burn , and will wear the whole oven .
worst chicken that they can cook in a stainless steel pan on a flat bench over their stove , and hot oil on top of the piece of vegetable , cleaned off .
this store had the only glove , it barely touched my hand . then there is one outlet open . i wasn t care for those oyster legs . what did my niece wear . ? .
the worst customer service while waiting for car at las vegas airport on hold no hold one hour after open three hours . [UNK] . they don t have a water pump . why don t you anyone even stand there a line ? .
be careful and not hop . they fall , it looks like a hill . so you either have to push the carts up , sit , or roll down there . just [UNK] are the pictures below ,
the beatles song , does not begin . but , if you like choreographed dance routines and do not want to perform their full for an aerial stunt so you cannot truly do any production trick . see again .
can you bite me hold it straight with the straight razor . and don t believe you not shave your naked sheep due to a coarse white wool ? .
amazing to see this production . incredible , from the costume , fabulous stunts and the performers singing and dance with an incredible energy . excellent choreography , if you do not perform , such a stunning style of choreography , the performers is right on center stage right in front of you so you don t have to wear any makeup though . i highly recommend this production in vegas ! .
